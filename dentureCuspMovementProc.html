    <td><h3><strong>Procedure:</strong></h3>
      <p>This video reviews the tracks or scribe lines that the lingual cusps of the maxillary denture teeth leave as the centric relation contact points move away during lateral excursive movement of the mandible. The final view is looking down through the transparent maxillary lingual cusp tips.      </p>
      <p>The first movement is the patient moving the mandible to their right. The blue scribe lines indicate the track that the maxillary non-working cusp tips will move through as the mandible functions. The green scribe lines indicate the track that the maxillary working cusp tips will move through as the mandible functions. The green lines attached to the anterior teeth indicate the “kissing” contacts that will occur during this functional movement.      </p>
      <p>The second movement is the patient moving their mandible to the left. The same colors and movements are noted.    </p>
    <p>The third movement is the patient making a protrusive movement straight forward. The blue scribe lines indicate the track the maxillary lingual cusps will move through as the mandible functions. The blue marks on anterior teeth indicate the “kissing” contacts that occur during this functional movement. </p></td>
