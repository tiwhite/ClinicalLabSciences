    <td><h3><strong>Procedure:</strong></h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Fit custom tray to patient. The borders of the tray should be 2mm short of contact to active vestibular borders. Tray should extend to the top of the retromolar pad in the posterior. Mark the top of the pad and masseter/buccinators muscle attachment at the disto-buccal corner with an indelible marker and transfer that information by seating the tray intraorally (Fig 01 and Fig 02).

        <p><img src="MandibularImpressions02.jpg" width="216" height="144" /><br />Fig 02</p></li>
        
        <li>Trim the tray slightly short of these landmarks (Fig 03 and Fig 04).

        <p><img src="MandibularImpressions04.jpg" width="216" height="144" /><br />Fig 04 (Sufficient reduction in buccal shelf area, 
more required in masseter muscle area)
</p></li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Modeling Plastic/Compound Instructions</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Dry the areas where modeling plastic will be added. Heat the stick while rotating slowly above a flame. Apply to tray when the material becomes soft. Use the hot water bath to make the material workable and shape with gloved fingers wet in water. Reheat the material with the hand torch and temper in the water bath before placing in the patient's mouth. (This instruction applies to each application of material)</li>
          <li>Apply modeling plastic to one side of the tray on the buccal border . Place the tray intraorally and perform muscle molding by manipulating the oral muscles to simulate normal function (Fig 05). 
            <p><img src="MandibularImpressions05.jpg" width="216" height="144" /><br />Fig 05 (Suggested sequence for adding modeling plastic during the border molding process.)</p>
 </li>
          <li>Remove excess material not associated with the border molding from the external and internal tray areas.</li>
          <li>Make corrections for areas with deficient tissue contact. If modeling plastic is added, re-warm the entire area with the hand torch, temper and seat the tray. Modify the tray if there are areas of over-extension or areas that are too thick. These areas are usually defined by the tray material showing through the border molding material.</li>
          <li>Continue border molding until the entire trays is correctly adapted to the vestibular areas. Move to the contralateral side and border mold the buccal border. Border mold each masseteric notch and retromolar pad area then proceed to capture the retromylohyiod area one-at-a-time finishing with the lingual sulcus (Fig 06).
          <p><img src="MandibularImpressions06.jpg" width="216" height="144" /><br />Fig 06</p></li>
          <li>The retromylohyoid area may need more than one application of border molding material to have sufficient length and bulk to capture the muscle attachments in this area. Having the patient close slightly as the tray is seated and touch the tip of the tongue to the incisive papilla may help.</li>
          <li>Remove any wax spacers or tissue stops, place vent holes through the tray. (Each retromolar pad and every 3cm around the tray)</li>
          <li>Slightly relieve all the modeling plastic border molding to provide space for the VPS light bodied impression material.</li>
          <li>Place VPS adhesive on the exposed tray.</li>
          <li>Cover the entire tray, including the border molded areas, with a light bodied VPS impression material. Seat the tray into proper position intraorally and perform border molding movements until the material is polymerized.</li>
          <li>Inspect the impression for voids, pressure spots, or other deficiencies and make corrections as needed.</li>
          <li>Disinfect the impression properly before removing it from the clinical area.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>VPS Instructions:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Apply VPS adhesive to one side of the tray on the buccal border . After the adhesive is set, place a bead of VPS heavy bodied impression material on the border of the tray. Place the tray intraorally and perform muscle molding by manipulating the oral muscles to simulate normal function. </li>
          <li>Remove excess material not associated with the border molding from the external and internal tray areas.</li>
          <li>Make corrections for areas with deficient tissue contact and modify the tray if there are areas of over-extension or areas that are too thick. These areas are usually defined by the tray material showing through the border molding material.</li>
          <li>Continue border molding until the entire trays is correctly adapted to the vestibular areas. Move to the contralateral side and border mold the buccal border. Border mold each masseteric notch and retromolar pad area then proceed to capture the retromylohyiod area one-at-a-time finishing with the lingual sulcus. Adhesive is added prior to each VPS addition (Fig 07).

</li>
          <li>The retromylohyoid area may need more than one application of border molding material to have sufficient length and bulk to capture the muscle attachments in this area. Having the patient close slightly as the tray is seated and touch the tip of the tongue to the incisive papilla may help.</li>
          <li>Remove any wax spacers or tissue stops, place vent holes through the tray. (Each retromolar pad and every 3cm around the tray)</li>
        <li>Place VPS adhesive on the exposed tray (Fig 08).        
<p><img src="MandibularImpressions08.jpg" width="216" height="144" /><br />Fig 08</p></li>  
          <li>Cover the entire tray, including the border molded areas, with a light bodied VPS impression material. Seat the tray into proper position intraorally and perform border molding movements until the material is polymerized.</li>
          <li>Inspect the impression for voids, pressure spots or other deficiencies and make corrections as needed (Fig 09).
          <p><img src="MandibularImpressions09.jpg" width="216" height="144" /><br />Fig 09</p></li>
 
      <li>Disinfect the impression properly before removing it from the clinical area.</li>
