    <td><h3><strong>Procedure:</strong></h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Examine the dentures prior to the patient’s arrival. Adjust obvious problems such as blebs of acrylic, unusable undercuts, flash and rough areas or sharp edges.</li>
        <li>Disinfect the dentures and rinse thoroughly.</li>
        <li>Paint a thin layer of Pressure Indicating Paste (PIP) on the intaglio surface (Fig 01) and carefully seat the denture with even pressure across the ridges. Remove the denture and examine the paste for indication of high pressure areas. These have the appearance of the material being absent often with a slight "halo" of the paste around the denuded portion.(Fig 02)
        <p><img src="CDInsertion01.jpg" width="216" height="144" /><br />Fig 01</p>
        <p><img src="CDInsertion02.jpg" width="216" height="144" /><br />Fig 02</p></li>
        <li>Make appropriate adjustments of these areas using an acrylic bur.</li>
        <li>Re-apply the PIP and continue adjustments until the intaglio surface makes even contact across all areas and the denture is fully seated.(Fig 03)
        <p><img src="CDInsertion03.jpg" width="216" height="144" /><br />Fig 03</p></li>
        <li>Repeat the procedure for the opposing denture.</li>
        <li>Evaluate the border extension and thickness. In areas where visual evaluation is difficult, use disclosing wax then check the borders. The wax is placed in quadrant areas in the same manner as border molding material would be placed. The denture is seated and allowed to warm to mouth temperature for 30-40 seconds. Perform border molding muscle movements and remove the dentures.</li>
        <li>Areas that show through the wax either in length or thickness should be adjusted with an acrylic bur and checked again. (Fig 04)
        <p><img src="CDInsertion04.jpg" width="216" height="144" /><br />Fig 04</p></li>
        <li>Place both dentures and examine them for esthetics and correct vertical relationships.</li>
        <li>Examine all areas for contour and proper thickness. Re-contour as necessary for retention and function. (Fig 05)
        <p><img src="CDInsertion05.jpg" width="216" height="144" /><br />Fig 05</p></li>
        <li>Make a centric relation record to articulate the prostheses on an articulator for final occlusal equilibration. Use remount casts for this procedure.</li>
        <li>If the laboratory did not preserve the facebow position, a new facebow recording will be needed to mount the maxillary remount cast.</li>

      <li>Use Aluwax gently warmed in a water bath to 120 degrees F. Place one layer of wax over the posterior teeth and manipulate the patient into the correct CR position. Have the patient close gently into the Aluwax without penetrating the recording material.</li>
      <li>Remove the record, cool in the iced water and trim the record. Check the record intra-orally for proper rotation of the mandibular teeth into the record. Double check midlines to make sure the patient did not deviate right or left.</li>
      <li>Mount the mandibular cast.</li>
      <li>Make a second record intra-orally to verify the initial record. </li>
      <li>Return the dentures to the articulator, open the centric latches and remove elastics from the condylar elements on the articulator. Place the dentures on their remount casts and seat the teeth into the record with firm pressure.</li>
      <li>Once the dentures are properly seated, inspect the relationship of the articulator condyles to the back-wall of the condylar housing.</li>
      <li>If the centric record matches the previous record the condyles will be touching the back wall bilaterally.</li>
      <li>If the condyles do not touch the back walls check wall settings on the articulator to insure they are set at zero. If the back wall settings are correct another record must be made to determine if the original record is in error or the record made at this appointment is in error.</li>
      <li>Two records must match for the verification process to be complete. If the record at this appointment proves to be correct, the mandibular cast must be remounted and that record verified. A new mounting will probably necessitate resetting the teeth and another try-in.</li>
      <li>Once the record is verified proceed to the final occlusal equilibration.</li></ul>
      <p><strong>Correcting Occlusal Disharmony</strong></p>
      
      <p>There are many intraoral methods for correcting occlusal disharmony. However, the intraoral methods are not accurate enough to insure proper occlusal contacts of opposing dentures. The resiliency of the supporting tissues allows the dentures to shift; therefore, markings are frequently false and misleading. The denture bases can move from the basal seat, causing the teeth in the opposite side of the arch or the opposite end of the arch to contact prematurely and produce an incorrect marking. Placing articulating paper on one side of the arch may induce the patient to close to or away from that side. Arch shaped articulating paper should be placed to minimize this problem if an intraoral adjustment is attempted.
      </p>
      <p>Adhesive green wax can be placed on the occlusal surfaces of the mandibular denture. Points of penetration that occur upon closing with the jaws in centric relation may be marked with a lead pencil and relieved where indicated. This method may also locate points of interference during functional movements. Again, the disadvantage of this method is that shifting of the dentures over resilient supporting tissues may give false markings. </p>
      <p><strong>Patient Remount and Selective Grinding</strong></p>
      <p>The patient remount method is to rearticulate the dentures on an articulator by means of interocclusal records made in the patient’s mouth. This is by far the most accurate occlusal adjustment procedure. It has the following advantages:<br />
        <br />
        1. It reduces patient participation.<br />
        2. It permits the dentist to see the procedures better.<br />
        3. It provides a stable working foundation; bases are not shifting on resilient tissues.<br />
        4. The absence of saliva makes possible more accurate markings with the articulating paper or tape.<br />
        5. Corrections can be made away from the patient, thus preventing occasional objections when patients see their new dentures being altered.<br />
        <br />
        To carry out a patient remount procedure, orient the mandibular denture to the maxillary denture by means of an interocclusal record with the jaws in centric relation. Place approximately 1.5 mm of passive-type wax on the occlusal surfaces of the mandibular teeth and soften by immersing in water at 130°F. Place the denture intraorally and guide the patient to close into the wax when the jaws are in centric relation. Closure must be short of tooth-to-tooth contact due to the chance that contact may displace the denture base. The wax record is not acceptable if the teeth penetrate to make contact. Carefully repeat the closure to verify the patient can close into the record without deviation from the centric arc of closure. </p>
      <p>The maxillary remount cast was fabricated and placed on the articulator by using a remount jig made in the dental laboratory immediately after the dentures were processed to preserve the facebow record. The dental laboratory generally returns the articulator with the properly positioned maxillary remount cast and a mandibular remount cast. After properly orienting the mandibular denture to the maxillary denture by means of the interocclusal record, secure it with sticky wax. Seat the mandibular remount cast in the denture and attach it to the mandibular member of the articulator with mounting stone.</p>
      <p>To check what has been recorded is the patient’s centric occlusion position, make another wax interocclusal record in the same manner as the first. Replace the dentures on the articulator and with the condylar elements freed, place the teeth in the indentations in the wax record. The condylar elements should rest against the stops. Repeat the procedure until two consecutive records are accepted. </p>
      <p>When cusp form posterior teeth are used and balanced occlusion is desired, it is best to have an even distribution of tooth contacts bilaterally. This involves a cusp-to-fossa marginal ridge relation of maximum intercuspation when the jaws are in the terminal hinge position. When the teeth move to and from centric to eccentric positions, the maxillary cusps track in three approximate directions.  An articulator that travels in a straight path does not travel the same path as the condyles in the fossae. It has been generally accepted that the error is so negligible that the resiliency of the supporting tissues accommodates for the error. There is no scientific proof that this assumption is correct, and this may not be true in all situations. Undoubtedly this error is tolerated by the majority of patients. When the jaws are moving to and from centric and eccentric positions, within the functional range of the teeth in gliding occlusion, the teeth can be altered to maintain harmonious contact on the articulator. This harmonious contact from fossae to cusp tips will not be exactly repeated in the mouth but is accepted as the most accurate adjustment possible.</p>
      <p>When the teeth are altered by selective grinding to make simultaneous cusp tip to cusp tip contact on both sides of the arch when the jaws are in a right or left lateral position, balanced occlusion in a static eccentric position exists. Some of these static contacts may be repeated in the mouth. When the mandible is in a straight protruded relation with the maxillae and the posterior teeth are altered to make cusp contacts at the same time the anterior teeth make incisal edge to incisal edge contact, balanced occlusion in protrusion exists. One may expect this static occlusal and incisal edge relation to exist in the mouth when the mandible is protruded to the same forward position.</p>
      <p>When teeth are arranged and the anteroposterior horizontal relations of the jaws are even (considered normally related), the buccal cusps of the mandibular posterior teeth and the lingual cusps of the maxillary posterior teeth maintain the occluding vertical dimension by contacting in the fossae and on the marginal ridges of their antagonists. When the horizontal position of the mandible is in a more forward position than the maxillae or in a situation where the mandible is larger in a lateral direction than the maxillae, the posterior teeth are frequently arranged in a reverse relation (Crossbite or Reverse Articulation). The buccal cusp tips of the maxillary posterior teeth and the lingual cusp tips of the mandibular posterior teeth maintain the occluding vertical dimension. After the occlusal surfaces of the teeth have been altered by grinding to achieve balanced occlusions with the jaws in centric relation, the cusps that maintain the occluding vertical dimension are not altered in subsequent adjustments.</p>
      <p><strong>Selective Grinding of Anatomic Teeth in a Balanced Occlusion</strong></p>
      <p>In the first step of selective grinding, cusp form teeth are altered by reshaping to obtain balanced occlusion when the jaws are in centric relation. Occlusal balance in a lateral direction is obtained by having all of the posterior teeth and the canines in contact on the working side and posterior contact only on the non-working side. In protrusive balance the anterior teeth should make incisal edge contact at the same time that the tips of the buccal and lingual cusps of the posterior teeth contact.</p>
      <p>Adjust the horizontal and lateral condylar inclinations of the articulator to the settings dictated by a protrusive interocclusal maxillomandibular relation record. The incisal pin should be raised off the table and secured.</p>
      <p>With the condylar elements against the centric relation stops, close the articulator until the posterior teeth are in contact. The anterior teeth should not be in contact. Examine the lingual cusps of the maxillary posterior teeth and the buccal cusps of the mandibular posterior teeth. Record the area or areas of premature contact with articulating paper. The contacts may be in varying amounts and may involve more than one cusp or tooth. These varying situations make critical evaluation necessary prior to grinding procedures in the centric position.</p>
      <p>Before grinding or adjusting the centric contacts, the excursive position contacts should also be evaluated. With the right condylar element in the centric position, place the lingual cusps of the maxillary posterior teeth in the non-working relation with the buccal cusps of the mandibular posterior teeth. This procedure also places the buccal and lingual cusps of the maxillary and mandibular posterior teeth and the canines in their working position on the opposite side. The teeth are placed in these positions and not shifted from the centric to the eccentric position with the teeth in contact. When the teeth on the non-working side are not in the correct relation, the error appears on the non-working or working side. If the non-working contact is excessive, the working side teeth will not be in contact. If the working side contact is excessive, the excess prevents contact on the non-working side. If the teeth on the working side are too long, there will be no contact on the non-working side. If a single tooth is high on the working side, there will be contact neither on the non-working side nor on the working side.<br />
        Record any premature contacts with articulating paper and repeat the procedure with the left side as the working side and record the premature contacts. If the cusp is high in the centric and in the eccentric position, reduce the premature cusp. If the cusp is high in the centric and not in the eccentric position, deepen the fossae or the marginal ridges. After all interceptive contacts have been removed in the centric and full eccentric position, do not reduce the maxillary lingual cusp or the mandibular buccal cusp and do not deepen the fossa or marginal ridge of any tooth. This will maintain the centric and eccentric holding cusp relationships.</p>
      <p>To refine the teeth to retain contact when the articulator is being moved to and from centric and eccentric position additional adjustments are needed. On the working side, reduce the inner inclines of the buccal cusps of the maxillary teeth and the lingual cusps of the mandibular teeth (Butt Rule). On the non-working side, reduce the inner inclines of the mandibular buccal cusps. If it is necessary to eliminate a centric cusp to correct balancing prematurities, eliminate the mandibular buccal cusp. This maintains the centric occlusal contact on the maxillary lingual cusp, which will better direct the forces of mastication against the mandibular denture which is generally less stable than the maxillary and will retain length to the lingual cusp, which is often necessary to establish protrusive balance. To achieve balance in protrusive excursion, reduce the distal inclines of the maxillary cusps and the mesial inclines of the mandibular cusps. After completing the selective grinding procedures to establish and maintain the desired occlusion refine the occlusal anatomy.</p>
      <p><strong>Selective Grinding Of Lingualized Balanced Occlusion</strong></p>
      <p>Correcting occlusal disharmonies in a balanced lingualized occlusion is similar to a fully balanced occlusion with the exception that only the lingual cusps of the maxillary teeth or their antagonist surfaces are adjusted. The same basic approach is used to evaluate where the disharmony exists and then correct it by reducing the mandibular fossae or marginal ridges in centric relation position. After the centric relation position is refined, the eccentric movements are adjusted on the slopes of the mandibular cusps as indicated in the fully balanced occlusal adjustment section. Since only the lingual cusps of the maxillary teeth are in contact this balanced set up is much less complicated to adjust.</p>
      <p><strong>Selective Grinding Of Non-anatomic Teeth</strong></p>
      <p>When non-cusp form posterior teeth or a non-balanced lingualized occlusal scheme are used and selective grinding procedures are instituted, the occlusal surfaces of the posterior teeth are altered to make harmonious contact on the right side and on the left side when the jaws are in centric relation.</p>
        <p>Secure the condylar elements on the articulator against the condylar housings and place articulating tape over the occlusal surfaces and incisal edges of all of the mandibular teeth. Tap the teeth together to record the contacting areas. Using an acrylic bur, grind the occlusal surfaces of the teeth until simultaneous even contacting areas on the right and left are developed. The anterior teeth should be slightly out of contact in the centric relation position but can make a “kissing” contact during lateral excursive movements. Smooth gliding movements from the centric position to eccentric positions should be developed by careful adjustment of opposing surfaces during excursive movements of the articulator. Exercise care to maintain the occlusal surfaces of the mandibular arch on a plane.</p>
