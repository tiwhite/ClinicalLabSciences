    <td><h3><strong>Procedure:</strong></h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Fit and adjust the denture set-ups intra-orally. Adhesive may need to be used to achieve retention and stability at this appointment.</li>
        <li>Place both dentures and evaluate facial support, lip length, occlusal plane placement. Use facial contours to establish the support evaluation (lip fullness, philtrum stretch, nasiolabial folds, etc.). Check that the occlusal plane is even with the lower lip and proceeds posterior to the correct level on the retro-molar pads. Verify teeth reside within the “neutral zone” for proper balance with the facial muscles.</li>
        <li>Use phonetic tests to verify tooth length and position. Begin with fricative sounds to determine contact with the lower lip and maxillary anterior teeth. Check “th” and “ch” sounds to determine the relation of the anterior teeth to the tongue and palate. Check “closest speaking” space (1-2mm in pre-molar area) with “s” sounds.</li>
        <li>Make appropriate adjustments if necessary by moving teeth in the wax set-up.</li>
        <li>Verify the proper Occluding Vertical Dimension by determining the patient’s Rest Vertical Dimension and Interocclusal Distance requirements. (See Inter-occlusal records App for the procedure)</li>
        <li>If the Occluding Vertical Dimension is too great (not enough Interocclusal distance) remove posterior teeth from one arch, re-establish the correct Occluding Vertical Dimension and make a new centric record at the correct vertical dimension. Have the teeth reset.</li>
        <li>If the Occluding Vertical Dimension is too short (excess Interocclusal Dimension) simply remake the centric record at the correct Occluding vertical Dimension and have the teeth reset.</li>
        <li>If the Occluding vertical dimension is reasonable proceed to checking the anterior-posterior mounting position of the casts on the articulator.</li>
        <li>Use Aluwax gently warmed in a water bath to 120 degrees F. Place one layer of wax over the posterior teeth and manipulate the patient into the correct CR position. Have the patient close gently into the Aluwax without penetrating the recording material.</li>
        <li>Remove the record, cool in the iced water and trim the record. Check the record intra-orally for proper rotation of the mandibular teeth into the record. Double check midlines to make sure the patient did not deviate right or left.</li>
        <li>Open centric latches and remove elastics from the condylar elements on the articulator. Place the dentures on their casts and seat the teeth into the record with firm pressure.</li>
        <li>Once the dentures are properly seated inspect the relationship of the articulator condyles to the back-wall of the condylar housing.</li>
        <li>If the centric record matches the previous record the condyles will be touching the back wall bilaterally.</li>
        <li>If the condyles do not touch the back walls check wall settings on the articulator to insure they are set at zero. If the back wall settings are correct another record must be made to determine if the original record is in error or the record made at this appointment is in error.</li>
        <li>Two records must match for the verification process to be complete. If the record at this appointment proves to be correct, the mandibular cast must be remounted and that record verified. A new mounting will probably necessitate resetting the teeth and another try-in. </li>
        <li>If no new records were needed, have the patient and their “significant other” (if available) approve the set-up in the dental record consent area.</li>
