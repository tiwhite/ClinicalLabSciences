    <td><h3><strong>Procedure:</strong></h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Please refer to the video for identification of the pertinent components of the Sirona Orthophos XG Plus panoramic machine including: the x-ray source, detector, head stabilizing bars, chin rest, bite block, support handles, control pad, and the adjustable mirror.</li>
        <li>When the patient is not properly positioned during image acquisition, the display of anatomical structures will change.</li>
        <li>Prior to having patient enter the panoramic unit, the unit should be adjusted to accommodate the height of the patient.</li>
        <li>Next, ask the patient to enter the panoramic machine and to utilize the support handles for additional comfort. </li>
        <li>First, one must ensure that the maxilla and mandible of the patient are located within the image layer of the panoramic unit.</li>
        <ul>
        	<li>The image layer is indicated by the indention in the bite block, though it should be noted that some other panoramic machines denote the position of the image layer with a positioning light rather than with the bite block.</li>
            <li>Care should be taken to ensure that the patient’s teeth are located within the indention of the bite block. Common positioning errors result from placing the patient either too far forward or too far back relative to the image layer. </li>
       </ul>
       <li>Next, the chin must be properly positioned.</li>
       <ul>
       		<li>This is achieved by aligning the horizontally oriented positioning light with the Frankfort Horizontal Plane (which runs from the infraorbital rim to the superior border of the external auditory meatus).</li>
            <li>Positioning the patient with their chin tipped too low or too high will create distortion of certain anatomical structures.</li>
       </ul>
       <li>Once the chin is properly positioned, the alignment of the midsagittal plane is verified.</li>
       <ul>
       		<li>The horizontally oriented positioning light is one of two positioning lights utilized by this particular panoramic unit, the Sirona Orthophos XG plus, to properly position the patient.   The second positioning light, which is vertical in orientation, is used to align the midsagittal plane.</li>
            <li>This vertically oriented positioning light will prevent the patient from being turned or tilted during image acquisition.</li>
            <li>The stabilizing bars may now be closed in order to prevent the patient’s head from moving.</li>
       </ul>
       <li>Once the midsagittal is aligned with the vertically oriented positioning light the patient should be positioned upright in the machine.</li>
       <ul>
       		<li>This ensures that the cervical spine is straight and therefore will prevent the ghost image of the spine from interfering with the visibility of the anterior maxilla and mandible (the anterior mandible in particular).</li>
            <li>Positioning the patient upright is accomplished by asking the patient to stand up straight and  advance their feet as far forward as possible.</li>
            <ul>
            		<li>One should note that the patient must hold onto the machine handles for support in order to avoid falling back. 
</li>
            </ul>
       </ul>
       <li>Lastly, just before acquiring the image, the patient should be asked to swallow and place their tongue on the roof of their mouth, close their lips, and remain still.</li>
       <li>You are now ready to acquire the image.</li>
